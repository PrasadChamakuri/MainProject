Now a days many researchers are used artificial intelligence technology for strongly engaged
in investigation on that recognizes, learns and acts on external information in a wide range of fields
those are technologies of computing big data and machine learning algorithms for combining, The
artificial intelligence technology is currently used in almost all industries, and many machine
learning experts are working on combining and standardizing different machine learning tools so
that non-experts will also easily apply them to their particular domain. The researchers are also
studying an autonomous machine learning as well as ontology construction for standardizing the
machine learning concepts.
